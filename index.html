                <h2>Study of the domain</h2>
                <p>Frieda Kahlo was a revolutionary. She reacted against the pain she faced throughout her life. She caught poliomyelitis when she was six and had a foot deviation. She used to paint self-portraits depicting her strong brows and her deep stare. .</p>
                <p>In 1926 she was injured badly at a tram crash, her spine, pelvis, and hips were permanently harmed. Her works became symbolic when she painted the Broken Column: her religious imagery and desolate landscape are a mirror of her mental state.  
                </p>
                <p>She had a long conflicted history with Diego Rivera, they were free together traveling the world fighting for the Mexican Revolution.  
                </p>
                <p>The Blue House in Mexico City became a museum dedicated to her life, blue as the open sky. 
                  Frieda never stopped expressing herself in the truest way possible, through Surrealism her mind was an open pond. 
                 </p>
                 <p>Frieda, as many Mexican artists working after the Revolutionary decade, began in 1910, was influenced by the nationalistic fervor: the Mexicanidad. These artists rejected European influences and found expressivity in folk tradition and their country’s native roots. 
                  It is possible to see Frieda’s influences and her artistic process in her personal diary. 
                  </p>
                  <p>She wanted peace, that’s why she changed her name to Fried(a), to protest against German Nazis. 
                  </p>
                  <p>When Frieda had a miscarriage, she painted her blood and interrupted pregnancies, while she used that blood to nurture plants. Frieda Kahlo: the woman behind the legend (TED video link). 
                    Nicolas Murray was a lover and a good friend for Frieda, they had epistolary exchanges. Murray was a photographer and took more than 60 pictures of Frieda during their 10 years of relationship. 
                    </p>
             
                
                <p>Her art was displayed for the first time in 1931 at the yearly meeting of the Women Artist Society, today (SFWA, LINK). Between our items we considered also the photographs displaying Frieda with the exiled Russian revolutionary leader Leon Trotsky. 
                </p>
             
                <p> 
                  She started wearing corsets to protest and show her truest emotions. Her pain is a constant in all her works.

                    Although her relationship with the Communist Revolutionary Leon Trotsky only lasted a few months, the artist was deeply influenced by the Mexicanidad movement. Frieda and her husband Diego, hosted Trotsky and his wife. Frieda and Trotsky had an affair, but after some time they remained friends. As Stalin’s power grew, Trotsky’s supportered diminuished and he eventually got killed. Frieda was questioned about his death but it was stalinist supporter who accomplished the murder. After their affair, Frieda painted Trotsky: he kept on living through her art.

                    Nickolas Muray was Kahlo’s friend and longtime lover.

                    La Casa Azul is the ultimate universe of Frieda Kahlo. It is the place where she was born and where she spent the majority of her life. It was her intention to leave it as a memorial to herself, that’s why Rivera turned it into a museum after her death. This house contains both artists’ paintings, pre-Columbian sculptures, photographs, books, and clothes (corset, Tehuana dresses).                   </p>

                    In this love letter to her lover, Frieda talks about her illness, her feelings toward the sculptor-painter Marcel Duchamp. She references an upcoming exhibition to be held at Pierre Colle, her plan to organize an exhibition in London. She thanked Nickolas for sending her money with a pseudonym, but she also tells him that she doesn’t need them.

                    In this article, Diego firstly displays the history of the founding cultures of the Pre-hispanic and Spanish periods and the 19th century. Mexican artists reclaimed their independence after colonialism. There were 2 main art streams: those who copied Picasso and Dalì, but also those who expressed their personality and mind through art, like Frieda did. This article represents one of the first art critics of Frieda.

                    In 1926 Frieda was injured on a tram accident which crashed on a car at 18 years old. Pain and suffering are a constant topic in Frida’s painting. In this symbolic painting the split in her torso looks like an earthquake fissure. Dressed with a hospital sheet, a broken column is put in place of her spine, looking like she is breaking into pieces. She has tears on her face, but she sends a message of moral triumph.

                    Frieda’s diary is a collection of notes and she drew in it. It was a way of connecting with her own feelings, and conveying her ideas in her artistic practice. Symbolism is present throughout her diary. Blue is the color of electricity and purity, while yellow represented madness, illness, fear, sometimes the sun, and happiness. </p>

          <p>The purpose of our conceptual map is to represent the extracted data, all in natural language. The main topic of our project is Frida Kahlo: a Mexican revolutionary painter. The items we have chosen are all relevant in order to tell the truth about her story. This representation follows natural language, while also trying to make explicit the relevant relationships with the objects and events which represent her. This map is fundamental in order to pass to the next step of the project: the E/R model.

    <p>This second model displays the relationships at a more abstracted layer. Here the predicates link entities and literals, rendering their connections as relationships. At the center of the map, there is Frida. We highlighted some of the main events of her life: she was part of the communist party (entity-entity relationship), she was in a tram accident (entity-entity relationship) and that’s why she painted the Broken Column (entitity-predicate-literal). She was a representative of the Communist party (entity-entity relationship). Frida’s path was interconnected with Diego Rivera (entity-entity relationship): they traveled and discovered the world together; she was also in a love-friendship relationship with Nickolas Muray (entity-entity relationship).
